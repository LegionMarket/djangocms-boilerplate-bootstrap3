Bootstrap 3 Boilerplate
=======================

Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing
responsive, mobile first projects on the web.

Designed for everyone, everywhere. Bootstrap makes front-end web development
faster and easier. It's made for folks of all skill levels, devices of all
shapes, and projects of all sizes.

Up to date with `Bootstrap <http://getbootstrap.com/>`_ **3.3.6**.

This boilerplate is compatible with `Divio Cloud <http://www.divio.com/>`_.

.. note::

    In order to work with django CMS, `index.html` has been renamed to
    `base.html` and assets have been moved to the `static/` folder.
